<b>Logic used:</b> Web Scraping<br><br>
<b>Points to Note:</b> 
<ul>
  <li>Not all websites allow webscraping, so don't send multiple requests to the same website as they might block you.</li>
  <li>The code is based on the website I used. Make the necessary changes to the code after inspecting the website HTML.</li>
  <li>The website I used is: http://books.toscrape.com/ - This website is really good to practice webscraping.</li>
